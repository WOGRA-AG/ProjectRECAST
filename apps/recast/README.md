# Recast

## Getting started

Before starting the frontend service, you need to update the `src/environments/environments.ts` file with your personal [Supabase] `DatabaseUrl` and your `<AnonAPIKey>`.

To start the frontend, run the following command:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

### Start Using RECAST

After the frontend has started locally, you can access [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to explore RECAST.
For more information and examples on how to use the platform, please refer to the [Documentation](https://wogra-ag.github.io/recast-docs).
