# RECAST: AI-Powered Quality Assurance for Welding Processes

### Overview
RECAST (ÜbeRwachung dEr SChweißquAlität durch künStliche InTelligenz) is a research initiative funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The project focuses on developing an intuitive and adaptable AI framework for process monitoring and quality assurance, with a primary application in welding processes for thermoplastic composite materials.

### Objectives
The main goals of the RECAST project are:
1. **Automating Manual Processes**: Replace manual steps in production chains with AI-driven solutions.
2. **Quality Assurance and Process Optimization**: Enable non-destructive, automated quality control for welding processes.
3. **Open-Source Development**: Deliver a freely available framework to encourage broad adoption in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
4. **Ease of Integration**: Allow SMEs to utilize AI technologies without prior expertise.

### Key Features
- **End-to-End Process Monitoring**: Utilize mobile and embedded devices for seamless data aggregation throughout the production lifecycle.
- **AI Integration**: Leverage AutoML and Transfer Learning to develop adaptable AI models for real-time decision-making.
- **Low-Code Accessibility**: Provide user-friendly tools for configuring processes and analyzing data via a web-based interface.
- **Open Source Framework**: Share the framework and related datasets to facilitate experimentation and knowledge sharing.

### Use Cases
The framework is being validated on welding processes such as:
- Continuous ultrasonic welding.
- Continuous resistance welding.

### Project Milestones
1. **Sensor Data Collection and Process Visualization**: Establish robust data acquisition and visualization systems.
2. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**: Develop models for detecting defects in welded components.
3. **Automated Model Creation**: Implement AutoML for building AI models directly on production equipment.
4. **Adaptive Process Optimization**: Use AI to optimize parameters for varying materials and forms.
5. **Transfer Learning**: Extend findings to additional processes, such as resistance welding.
