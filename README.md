# RECAST: AI-Powered Quality Assurance for Welding Processes

### Overview
RECAST (ÜbeRwachung dEr SChweißquAlität durch künStliche InTelligenz) is a research initiative funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The project focuses on developing an intuitive and adaptable AI framework for process monitoring and quality assurance, with a primary application in welding processes for thermoplastic composite materials.

### Objectives
The main goals of the RECAST project are:
1. **Automating Manual Processes**: Replace manual steps in production chains with AI-driven solutions.
2. **Quality Assurance and Process Optimization**: Enable non-destructive, automated quality control for welding processes.
3. **Open-Source Development**: Deliver a freely available framework to encourage broad adoption in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
4. **Ease of Integration**: Allow SMEs to utilize AI technologies without prior expertise.

### Key Features
- **End-to-End Process Monitoring**: Utilize mobile and embedded devices for seamless data aggregation throughout the production lifecycle.
- **AI Integration**: Leverage AutoML and Transfer Learning to develop adaptable AI models for real-time decision-making.
- **Low-Code Accessibility**: Provide user-friendly tools for configuring processes and analyzing data via a web-based interface.
- **Open Source Framework**: Share the framework and related datasets to facilitate experimentation and knowledge sharing.

### Use Cases
The framework is being validated on welding processes such as:
- Continuous ultrasonic welding.
- Continuous resistance welding.

### Project Milestones
1. **Sensor Data Collection and Process Visualization**: Establish robust data acquisition and visualization systems.
2. **AI-Assisted Quality Control**: Develop models for detecting defects in welded components.
3. **Automated Model Creation**: Implement AutoML for building AI models directly on production equipment.
4. **Adaptive Process Optimization**: Use AI to optimize parameters for varying materials and forms.
5. **Transfer Learning**: Extend findings to additional processes, such as resistance welding.

### Publications
Several papers related to the RECAST project have already been published, contributing to the fields of AI and welding 
process optimization. Links to these publications will be added as soon as they are available.
